## Functionalities

I have added several functionalities to enhance the user experience and make the UI more interactive. Here are the key additions:

- **IconButtons:** Added support for setting the icon size and implemented a hover option for better visual feedback.
- **CheckButtons and RadioButtons:** Introduced right-to-left (RTL) language support for improved usability.
- **ToggleButtons:** Implemented the ability to set a custom background color.
- **FlatButton:** Added the functionality to set content margins.
- **Theme Enhancements:** Introduced extra theme Role enums to provide more options for customization.

## UI/UX Improvements

In addition to the added functionalities, I have also made several UI/UX improvements to enhance the overall user experience. These improvements include:

- **Hover Features for Icons:** Implemented hover effects for icons to provide better visual cues and feedback.
- **Improved Animation Support:** Created a new class called `hoverStateMachine`, which can be utilized in any other class to perform animations on events like mouse enter/leave or show/hide events.
- **Fixes:** Resolved the click issue in IconButton for smoother interaction.

Feel free to explore the repository and take advantage of these enhancements and improvements in your projects.
